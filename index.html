                        century. The style originated at the turn of the century with a move toward industrialization
                        and gained popularity throughout the first half of the century. Both midcentury modern (popular
                        in the '40s through '60s) and post-modern design (from '70s onward) evolved from modern design.
                        "Modernism was the future in the early midcentury. It harnessed the capability of machinery to
                        offer affordable housing and furniture solutions to the masses.</p>
